# Add a product to the cart automatically

You can set up your cart to automatically include a product as a gift. The product is added automatically when any other item is added to an empty cart.

To add a product to your cart automatically:

* [Grab the handle of your add-on product](#grab-product-handle)
* [Create a new snippet](#create-snippet)
* [Include the new snippet in your cart template](#include-snippet)

This customization is not possible if your cart uses Ajax. If you use any of the following themes: Solo, Pop, React, Classic, Supply or Brooklyn, by Shopify, you must disable Ajax on your [Customize theme page](http://www.shopify.com/admin/themes/current/editor). In the **Cart page** section, set "Cart type" to "Page".

On the product page, under **Search engine listing preview**, click the *Edit website SEO* link.

The product handle is shown under 'URL and handle':

![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/k2xFhnnXbz0DFJKaD3WrRJqHDv1qFK.png)

In the above example, the handle is `surprise-gift-35-value`. You will need that handle later.

<h2 id="create-snippet">Creating a new code snippet</h2>

1. Go to the [Edit HTML/CSS page](https://docs.shopify.com/manual/configuration/store-customization/#template-editor).

2. Click the **Snippets** folder, then click **Add a new snippet**.

3. Give your snippet the name `cart-add-on` and click **Create snippet**. Your snippet will automatically open in the online code editor.

4. Copy the code from this project's snippet.liquid file into your snippet.

5. Look for the following text on line no 5:

   `put-your-product-handle-here`

   Replace that text with the product handle you grabbed in the first step above.

6. Click **Save** to save your new code snippet.

<h2 id="include-snippet">Including the new snippet in your cart template</h2>

Now you must edit your cart.liquid template to include your new code snippet.

1. Under the **Templates** folder, locate and click on _cart.liquid_ to open it in the online code editor.

2. Copy the below code at the top of your cart.liquid snippet:

   `{% include 'cart-add-on' %}`
   
3. Click **save**.
